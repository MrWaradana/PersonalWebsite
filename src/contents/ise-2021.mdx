# ISE 2021

## Short Description

ISE! is an abbreviation of Information Systems Expo which is an annual event organized by the Information Systems Department of the
Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology Surabaya in order to introduce the ITS Information Systems Department to the wider
community.

## Background

This event is my first time to be a web developer. I didn't know anything about web development before. I learned a lot of things from this event. I learned about the basics of web development, how to use git, and how to work with a team. I also learned about the importance of teamwork.

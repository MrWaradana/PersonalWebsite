## Short Description

ISE! is an abbreviation of Information Systems Expo which is an annual event organized by the Information Systems Department of the
Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology Surabaya in order to introduce the ITS Information Systems Department to the wider

I learned about the basics of web development, what is a framework (laravel), what is a library (Jquery), how to use git, and how to work with a team. I also learned about the importance of teamwork.

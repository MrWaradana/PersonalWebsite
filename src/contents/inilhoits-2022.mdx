## Short Description

Ini Lho ITS! 2023 is an annual event that helps the high schoolers to find majors that match their dreams, talents, and interests. Usually, we have a series of events consisting of: OPEN CAMPUS, VISIT, and WELCOME. Unfortunately, this year pandemic of Covid-19 prevents us to meet up directly so that we provide a new event called SHOW OFF and INSPIRATIVE TALKSHOW to introduce you more about our campus.

## Background

Got invited to participate in a project to develop a website for Ini Lho ITS! 2022. This project is a collaboration between the IT Division and the Design Division of Ini Lho ITS! 2022. The website is built using Laravel and Bootstrap. The website is also integrated with the Google Form API to collect the data from the participants.
